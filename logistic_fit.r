# note: target average proposal acceptance probability during stanâ€™s adaptation 
# period, and increasing it will force Stan to take smaller steps. The downside
# is that sampling will tend to be slower because a smaller step size means that
# more steps are required. Since the validity of the estimates is not guaranteed
# if there are post-warmup divergences, the slower sampling is a minor cost.

# sum_err decreased after addition of x2

# in terms of interpretation with two vars, something seems off
# in season data very sparse
# possible overfitting
# x1 and x2 together drastically improve model's prediction for early season
# performance but not for inference
## suspicious -- not uncommon with logistic models
# due to degeneracy in the model? countered by a strong, informative prior
